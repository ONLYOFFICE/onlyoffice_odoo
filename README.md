## Installing ONLYOFFICE Docs

You will need an instance of ONLYOFFICE Docs (Document Server) that is resolvable and connectable both from Odoo and any end-clients. ONLYOFFICE Document Server must also be able to POST to Odoo directly.

You can install free Community version of ONLYOFFICE Docs or scalable Enterprise Edition.

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-community-install-ubuntu.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.  

To install Enterprise Edition, follow instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/installation/docs-enterprise-index.aspx).

Community Edition vs Enterprise Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-docs-editions).

## Installing Odoo ONLYOFFICE integration app

**Installation from the admin panel**

* [Log into](https://www.odoo.com/web/login) your exisiting Odoo account or [sign up](https://www.odoo.com/web/signup) for a new account.
* Go to the Odoo administration panel and click ‘Apps’ on the top menu bar.
* Search for ONLYOFFICE in the Apps catalog. 
* Click the 'Install' button.

**Manual installation**

Navigate to the [Odoo Apps catalog](https://apps.odoo.com/apps) and select the Odoo version you have installed. Search for ONLYOFFICE and download it. You can also download the latest app version from the official [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice-odoo/releases).

Put ONLYOFFICE connector into `/path/to/odoo/addons`. Make sure the ONLYOFFICE folder is named as `onlyoffice_odoo`.

Alternatively, you can add the following lines in the `/path/to/odoo/config/odoo.conf` file specifying your path to the folder with apps/addons:

```
[options]
addons_path = /mnt/extra-addons
```

Then, install the package:
`pip install pyjwt`

Once ready, switch your Odoo to the developer mode and click **Apps -> Update Apps List** OR just restart your Odoo instance.
 
## Configuring Odoo ONLYOFFICE integration app

To configure the app, go to `Settings`. Find `ONLYOFFICE` on the left sidebar and press it. Specify the URL of the installed ONLYOFFICE Document Server.

Starting from version 7.2, JWT is enabled by default and the secret key is generated automatically to restrict the access to ONLYOFFICE Docs and for security reasons and data integrity. 
You can specify your own **Secret key** on the Odoo configuration page. 
In the ONLYOFFICE Docs [config file](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/signature/), specify the same secret key and enable the validation.
